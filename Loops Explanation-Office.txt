C provides three primary types of loops:

🔹 1. for Loop
🔸The for loop is used when the number of     iterations is known in advance.
🔸It combines initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement in one line.
⚫Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}

🔸Use Case:
Printing a sequence of numbers
Iterating over arrays
Repeated fixed-count tasks


🔹 2. while Loop
🔸The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.
🔸The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

⚫Syntax:
      
while (condition) {
    // repeated code block
}

🔸Use Case:
Processing digits of a number
Waiting for a condition to change
Reading input until a stop value is found


🔹 3. do-while Loop
🔸The do-while loop ensures the block of code is executed at least once, because the condition is checked after the loop body.
⚫Syntax:
     
do {
    // code block executed at least once
} while (condition);

🔸Use Case:
Menus and user-driven programs
Multiplication tables
Input validation loops
